    <h1>Basketball Fantasy App</h1>
    <h2>Welcome to the Basketball Fantasy App Beta</h2>
    <p>Thank you for your interest in our fantasy basketball app. We are currently in beta testing, and we're excited to have you join us!</p>
    
    <h2>About the Game</h2>
    <p>Our NBA fantasy app offers a unique twist on traditional fantasy basketball. Instead of drafting entire teams, you select individual players based on specific statistical categories. Compete against friends and other users to see who can build the best roster across various stats like points, rebounds, assists, and more.</p>
    <p>With real-time updates and a user-friendly interface, our app makes it easy to manage your team and track your performance throughout the season.</p>
